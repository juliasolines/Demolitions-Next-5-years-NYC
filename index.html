        <h1>WHAT COULD THE NEXT 5 YEARS OF NEW YORK CITY’S DEMOLITIONS LOOK LIKE?</h1>
        <p>The following map explores the 5 years of demolitions in NYC. </p>
        <p>A machine learning model trained on data from 2010-2023 from the NYC Housing Databse, the NYC Pluto Database 
            and the NYC Census Database flagged buildings that could (with 70% accuracy) undergo
            demolition from 2025-2030. Each gray circle represents a demolished construction. The
            reasons for demolitions include year of building construction, rent cost, BBL, address, 
            borough and tenant tax brackets. 
        </p>
        <h2> We encourage you to find buildings you know, buildings you care about and love, and 
            protect them. Our homes are an extension of our bodies. We are our city, and it is being demolished.
